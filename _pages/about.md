Dr. Shibaji Chakraborty is a `Postdoctoral Associate` at [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu/) since `May 2021`, specializing in Space Weather research. With a focus on the effects and impacts of Space Weather on HF propagation using SuperDARN, he has accumulated three years of experience in the [SuperDARN Group](https://vt.superdarn.org/), working under the supervision of Dr. Joseph [Baker](https://ece.vt.edu/people/profile/baker.html) and Dr. J. Michael [Ruohoniemi](https://ece.vt.edu/people/profile/ruohoniemi.html). His research primarily revolves around the study of solar flare-driven Shortwave-Fadeout and aims to provide a probabilistic now-cast of ionospheric HF propagation conditions during solar flares. Dr. Chakraborty employs various tools and software in his research, including Python, MATLAB, Word, Latex/Overleaf, [pyDARN](https://pydarn.readthedocs.io/en/main/), and SQLite.

Before his tenure at Virginia Tech, Dr. Chakraborty served as an `Information Technology Analyst` at [Tata Consultancy Services Innovation Labs](https://www.tcs.com/what-we-do/research) from `September 2010 to July 2015`. During this period, he gained `4.75` years of valuable experience working on diverse projects, including the Home Energy Management System and Device Management System. His role involved handling different software development modules like API and APP gateway, automated user application deployment module, distributed task queue, and Sensor data explorer (Cloud-based). He utilized a wide range of tools and software, such as Python, Java, C, Java-Script, Lua, HTML, XML, JSON, CSS, Scala, Akka (Parallel computational Framework), Redis, and MySQL.
