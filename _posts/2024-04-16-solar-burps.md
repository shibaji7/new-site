It was last week of August 2017, start of Fall semister, I was rushing in my bike towrads Hutcheson Hall, Virginia Tech, to attend my graduate-level probability class. I received an email alart in my phone from NOAA stating there was a strong chance in Solar Storm that might impact Earth by next week. Being a noob in the field at that time (although I do not consider myself a connisure yet…) it felt increadibly imposible to observe a senario like that during a declining phase of the last solar cycle. Eventually, they were right about the prediction and there was the biggest solar storm of that solar cycle that hits the Earth. NASA call these solar storms Solar Burps.

The Sun in visible spectrum, light that that human eye is sensitive to, looks remarkably consistent, nonchalantly poweing our solar system by its light and heat without any expectation from us or any other planet of the solar system for that matter.

Now the major questions are:
* Should we worry about the solar storms that are heading towrads us? Should we hunker down inside and disconnect our Kitchen appliences, TV, phone and internet?
* OR, is this just hype about a non-event made by media?

Just like most of the other things in life, the reality is somewhere between 'yes' and 'no'. The subjective nature comes from the . Solar storm can create very real damages to electrical equipments. March 1989 storm created a few dark nights over Quebec, Canada by causing severe damages to power feed lines. Approximately, five years later two of the Anik communication satellites were taken out of commission, one for hours, another for months, due to a solar storms. These storms can destroy satellitght by deorbiting them from their trajectories. For example, a 2022 solar storm resulted in the Starlink transmitters drifting back into Earth’s atmosphere, where they will burn up, potentially costing the company about $100 million.

> But how do solar storms create havoc in electrical equipments and satellites and spare us? What are these solar storms actually anyway?

Let's start target the second question first. As mentioned earlyer the Sun is anything but clam, but that is in X-ray and EUV spectrum. Infact the Sun's atmosphere is highly active. When Sun "Burps!", it spews stellar material and magnetic fields from the surface of the sun towrads the solar system- some time towrads the Earth. These burps often associated with other solar events, such as, X-rays, charged particles, and magnetized plasma across the solar system. 

Sun being the powerhouse of the solar system it released enormus amount of power `every second`, roughly `25 trillion` (i.e. 25,000,000,000,000!) times that required by the inhabitants of the Earth. Let us digest the fact, first, it is $$25\times 10^12$$ times of all mankind's need! For analogy, a typical house hold needs `1000 watts` (killo watts) per second, while its supplier power plant generates power in `Million (Mega) Watts` $$10^6$$. So, as per this analogy there are `1,000,000` power plant with each having capacity of `25 mega watts` supplying power to one `House`.

This huge amount of power in the Sun are generated by `nuclear fusion` recation and `solar magnetic fields`, creating it a `plasma blob` in space. These complex processes make Sun's surface bubble like a cauldron. We can see structure on scales from thousands of kilometers down to just a few (see this incredible image for an example) and probably smaller. However, some of the stuctures may be in the order of Earth or some times 100s of Earth (check previous image on top). Additionally, we can see `extremely bright and dark spots` on top of the Sun's surface.

These extremely bright and dark spots are referred to as `solar active regions` and `Sun spots`. All these structures are stem from `intense magnetic field activity` and `plasma processes`. They posses enormous amounts of stored energy within them and act like storage units with an assoicated storage limit. The magnetic and plasma activities diposites energy into these regions continuously or in a semi-perodically. If regions are unable to tore the energy then they release it to outer space by producing huge flares/eruptions which send billions of tons of hot `plasma` (energetic paricles) into space travelling at two million kilometers per hour, commonly known as `Coronal Mass Ejection (CME)` or `Solar Burps`.

Now, lets deal with the second question on why these solar storms spare us, humans or any other living organisms, and impact the electrical equipments. Answere to this question is two-fold. First, unlike tropical strom (stem from atmospheric temperature or pressure difference) solar storms are `magnetic storms`. What do I mean by that? In short, these storms stems from electric and magnetic potential difference. I will discuss that in details in a seperate post. 

> Why `magnetic storm` is a problem for electrical equipments?
Well, over 200 year ago `Michael Faraday` demonstrated that if you hold a bar-magnet and move it rapidly near a wire, it will produce an electric current through the wire. It is the same principal that is used by `turbine-dynamo` in power plants to create electrical power. It’s a really simple but incredibly profound idea, scientist called it `electromagnetic induction`. These solar `magnetic storms` can change magnetic field around the Earth that are hundreds of thousends of kilometers long, leading to a strong induction on the Earth surface. Now the wires around us, some of them are tens and hundreds of kilometers across, start getting some serious electrical currents induced. One example was, March 1989 strom, that caused enough electrical surge to shut down the Quebec power grid. Hence, `electromagnetic induction` the electrical equipments on power grids are `prone` to large scale `magnetic storms` unlike humans.

While the we are not succeptable to magnetic induction but `high energy plasma` can cause severe damage to any living organism. But the good news is magnetic field around the Earth protects us from the worst of these high energy particles. Our atmosphere also protects us from these solar radiations and energetic particles.

> Are we often right in the firing line?
The short answere to this question is `yes`. While billions of tons of plasma (and X-rays) travelling at `relativistic speed` (a speed that reaches the speed of light) like it would wipe out everything in its path, by the time it reaches the Earth it’s spread out over a vast area. This space near the Earth, where there is no atmosphere or we are proteceted by Earth's magnetic field is called near-Earth space or `Geo-space`. The density of the plasma is so low here taht if you could imagine standing up in the `wind` of particle travelling at millions of kilometers an hour, you wouldn’t feel a thing, but your body cells will. While one short doese of these these high energy plasma particles  might not kill you but a prolonged and constant bombardment of DNA leads to cancer. That’s one of the reasons why sending astronauts to Mars is so tough. But, don't worry if you are not travelling to Mars. I guess Elon is building some protective shealding for us in his space shuttel to Mars.

Imagination aside, these are severe impact on our modern civilization. Loosing satellites, power grids can cost billions of dollars. Most of them can cause irreplaceble damages, not to mention public safety issues. So it should come as no surprise that predicting these events, and building in safety measures for both satellites and power distribution systems is one of the primary goal of national security. Early warning systems are well in place now – we get anywhere between two and five days notice. Check NOAA websites if you want to get more details on this.

Every stom comes with a `Rainbow`. Just like any tropical storm, `magnetic storm` create its own `Rainbow`, we refer it as `Aurora`. It is out of the world scean one can expeiance. Earth's magnetic fields that diverts the energetic palsma particles, traps a part of those eneregtic particles and stream them around the Earth's magnetic pole causeing `Aurora`. More about `Aurora` and their formation mechanism in a later post...

In summary, we have not seen really seen a truely large `solar storm` and associated `magnetic storm` in over 100 years. Neither of these two events in March 1989 or Spetember 2017 compares to the great solar storm of 1859 (`Carrington Event`), which known to be the largest known `solar storm`. With insurgence of modern numerical techqiues and AI tool we `think` we have the capability of predicting the scale of a large `solar storm`. The reality migth be much grave than what we expecet, the reason of our reliance of electriacl equipments and satellites incraesing day-by-day, and we are unaware of the fact how much a `Carrington Event` may cost us!

While, Sun may give us life, one extra big `Burp` could produce some grave problems. I would like to 'think' myself as a non-belever, but may be this is the reason ancient civilizations treated the Sun as a God!
