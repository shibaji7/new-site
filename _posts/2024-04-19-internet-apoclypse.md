If I would have written this article before 2020; the word 'Apoclypse' would have taken me to my childhood days. Just like any other Indian millenial kid, my toddler and teanage days were full of stories. My 'audio book', my grandmother, used to read out stories from old Hindu scriptures. Many of them are depiction of apocalyptical days. Obviously I heard in my native language bengali! However, the 2020-2021 'Black Swan' days completley reshaped my associatve memory about the word 'Apoclypse'.

### Know the source of the term 'Internet Apoclypse'
Being a Space Weather researcher I came accross this scientific paper: '[Solar Superstorms: Planning for an Internet Apocalypse](https://ics.uci.edu/~sabdujyo/papers/sigcomm21-cme.pdf)' written by [Dr. Jyothi](https://ics.uci.edu/~sabdujyo/) few years back, while working with one of the renound sceintist in the field of space weather [Dr. Boteler](https://i.cbc.ca/1.3569967.1462549552!/fileImage/httpImage/david-boteler.jpg). [Dr. Jyothi](https://ics.uci.edu/~sabdujyo/) is an Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science at UCLA, Irvine. The paper describes the impact of '[Solar Superstorms](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018JA026425)' on the global internet infrastructure. There is special category of solar storms, leading to large Coronal Mass Ejections ([CMEs](2024-04-16-solar-burps.md)), which then induce larger than expected `magnetic storm` at near-Earth or `Geospace` environment. Scientist at [NOAA](https://www.noaa.gov/) and [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) call them `Solar Superstorms`. The [paper](https://ics.uci.edu/~sabdujyo/papers/sigcomm21-cme.pdf) claims that 'it investigated the impact of solar superstorms that can potentially cause large-scale Internet outages covering the entire globe and lasting several months', and termed this impact as 'Internet Apoclypse'. Sounds like so `end-of-days`!

Enough of these jokes, let's come to the facts. After that this term 'Internet Apoclypse' picked up by various media and projected as 'End-of-Day' scenario and used it as a click-bait to gain profit. I

Lets starts from the top, [Jyothi et al.](https://ics.uci.edu/~sabdujyo/papers/sigcomm21-cme.pdf) mentioned the `Solar Superstorm` as a Black-swan event for internet infrastructire. The long distance internet cables that
