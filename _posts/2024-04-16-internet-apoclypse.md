It was last week of August 2017, start of Fall semister, I was rushing in my bike towrads Hutcheson Hall, Virginia Tech, to attend my graduate-level probability class. I received an email alart in my phone from NOAA stating there was a strong chance in Solar Storm that might impact Earth by next week. Being a noob in the field at that time (although I do not consider myself a connisure yetâ€¦) it felt increadibly imposible to observe a senario like that during a declining phase of the last solar cycle. Eventually, they were right about the prediction and there was the biggest solar storm of that solar cycle that hits the Earth. NASA call these solar storms Solar Burps.
