### Know source of the term 'Internet Apoclypse'
Being a Space Weather researcher I came accross the paper '[Solar Superstorms: Planning for an Internet Apocalypse](https://ics.uci.edu/~sabdujyo/papers/sigcomm21-cme.pdf)' by [Dr. Jyothi](https://ics.uci.edu/~sabdujyo/). She is an Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science at UCLA, Irvine. The paper describes the impact of '[Solar Superstorms](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018JA026425)' on internet infrastructure. There is special category of solar storms, which can create havock on `geospace` environemnt by inducing larger than expected `magnetic storm`. Scientist at [NOAA](https://www.noaa.gov/) and [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) call them `Solar Superstorms`. The [paper](https://ics.uci.edu/~sabdujyo/papers/sigcomm21-cme.pdf) claims that 'it investigated in the impact of solar superstorms that can potentially cause large-scale Internet
outages covering the entire globe and lasting several months', and this impact is termed as 'Internet Apoclypse'.
