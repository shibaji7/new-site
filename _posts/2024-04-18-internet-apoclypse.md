<blockquote>
Just like any other Indian millenial kid, my toddler and teanage days were full of stories. My 'audio book', my grandmother, used to read out stories from old Hindu scriptures. Many of them are depiction of apocalyptical days. Obviously I heard in my native language bengali: 'সর্বনাশ'. That is the first time I heard the word. There are two takeaways I still remeber: fist, these apocalyptical days came with a life threat.

### Know the source of the term 'Internet Apoclypse'
Being a Space Weather researcher I came accross the paper '[Solar Superstorms: Planning for an Internet Apocalypse](https://ics.uci.edu/~sabdujyo/papers/sigcomm21-cme.pdf)' by [Dr. Jyothi](https://ics.uci.edu/~sabdujyo/). She is an Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science at UCLA, Irvine. The paper describes the impact of '[Solar Superstorms](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018JA026425)' on internet infrastructure. There is special category of solar storms, leading to large Coronal Mass Ejections ([CMEs](2024-04-16-solar-burps.md)), which then induce larger than expected `magnetic storm` at near-Earth or `Geospace` environment. Scientist at [NOAA](https://www.noaa.gov/) and [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) call them `Solar Superstorms`. The [paper](https://ics.uci.edu/~sabdujyo/papers/sigcomm21-cme.pdf) claims that 'it investigated the impact of solar superstorms that can potentially cause large-scale Internet
outages covering the entire globe and lasting several months', and termed this impact as 'Internet Apoclypse'. The [paper](https://ics.uci.edu/~sabdujyo/papers/sigcomm21-cme.pdf) reasoned `Solar Superstorms` drives  

After that this term picked up by various media and projected as 'End-of-Day' scenario. 

In summary, [the study](https://ics.uci.edu/~sabdujyo/papers/sigcomm21-cme.pdf)
