Short-wave fadeout (SWF), a transient ionospheric response to solar flares, disrupts HF communication by enhancing ionization in the D-layer, causing severe absorption of HF radio signals. This study introduces two probabilistic anomaly detection schemes for identifying SWF events generated by M and X class flares in Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) observations. Leveraging statistical Z-score and nonlinear energy operators, the schemes exhibit varying performance influenced by flare intensity and scheme parameters. Remarkably, a correlation coefficient of ~0.73 is observed between monthly flare and SWF counts, underscoring the effectiveness of the Z-score scheme in detecting SWF events.

Figure illustrates Blackstone (BKS) radar measurements and GOES X-ray fluxes on March 11, 2015. The X2.2 class flare at 16:22 UT led to a rapid decrease in backscatter echoes within 10 minutes, causing a complete radio blackout followed by a gradual recovery over 30–60 minutes. The M1.0 class event initiated compoundly, with a small C-class onset around 8:40 UT followed by a larger M-class onset at 8:45 UT. While the M-class event showed a weaker response with a subtle decrease in BKS backscatter echoes, the X-class flare exhibited a distinct inverted spike, a characteristic signature of short-wave fadeout commencement. This observation aligns with previous studies, emphasizing the unique signatures associated with different flare classes.

### Detection Schemes
In this study we have used two different spike detection techniques to identify SWF signatures in SuperDARN backscatter observations. First, a modified Z-score based spike detection technique, also referred as the Whitaker-Hayes algorithm, and second, a nonlinear energy operator (NEO).

#### A. Modified Z-score
Z-score represents how many standard deviations away a given observation is from the mean. By contrast, the modified Z-score is estimated using the median ($$M$$) and median absolute deviation ($$MAD$$) instead of mean and standard deviation. Equation 1 presents the modified Z-score assuming the backscatter count ( `$$e_n$$` ) is normally distributed. The multiplier 0.6745 in the equation is the 0.75 th quartile of the standard normal distribution, to which the `$$MAD$$` converges:

\[
    z(e_n) = 0.6745 \times \frac{e_n - e_n^M}{e_n^{MAD}}
\]
where: \[e^M_n\], \[eMADn\], and \[z(e_n)\] are the median, median absolute deviations, and Z-score of backscatter count (\[e_n\]). For a spike the \[z(e_n)\] value is high.

#### B. Nonlinear Energy Operator
