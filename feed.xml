I received an email alart in my phone from NOAA stating there was a strong chance in Solar Storm that might impact Earth by next week. Being a noob in the field at that time (although I do not consider myself a connisure yet…) it felt increadibly imposible to observe a senario like that during a declining phase of the last solar cycle. Eventually, they were right about the prediction and there was the biggest solar storm of that solar cycle that hits the Earth. NASA call these solar storms Solar Burps.</p> <p>The Sun in visible spectrum, light that that human eye is sensitive to, looks remarkably consistent, nonchalantly poweing our solar system by its light and heat without any expectation from us or any other planet of the solar system for that matter.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="sample-posts"/><category term="CME"/><category term="GMD"/><category term="Flare"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In reality it's anything but calm]]></summary></entry></feed>
