  ABSTRACT={Submarine cables have become a vital component of modern infrastructure, but past submarine cable natural hazard studies have mostly focused on potential cable damage from landslides and tsunamis. A handful of studies examine the possibility of space weather effects in submarine cables. The main purpose of this study is to develop a computational model, using Python, of geomagnetic induction on submarine cables. The model is used to estimate the induced voltage in the submarine cables in response to geomagnetic disturbances. It also utilizes newly acquired knowledge from magnetotelluric studies and associated investigations of geomagnetically induced currents in power systems. We describe the Python-based software, its working principle, inputs/outputs based on synthetic geomagnetic field data, and compare its operational capabilities against analytical solutions. We present the results for different model inputs, and find: 1) the seawater layer acts as a shield in the induction process: the greater the ocean depth, the smaller the seafloor geoelectric field; and 2) the model is sensitive to the Ocean-Earth layered conductivity structure.},

  abstract = {Abstract Sudden enhancement in high-frequency absorption is a well-known impact of solar flare-driven Short-Wave Fadeout (SWF). Less understood, is a perturbation of the radio wave frequency as it traverses the ionosphere in the early stages of SWF, also known as the Doppler flash. Investigations have suggested two possible sources that might contribute to it’s manifestation: first, enhancements of plasma density in the D-and lower E-regions; second, the lowering of the F-region reflection point. Our recent work investigated a solar flare event using first principles modeling and Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) HF radar observations and found that change in the F-region refractive index is the primary driver of the Doppler flash. This study analyzes multiple solar flare events observed across different SuperDARN HF radars to determine how flare characteristics, properties of the traveling radio wave, and geophysical conditions impact the Doppler flash. In addition, we use incoherent scatter radar data and first-principles modeling to investigate physical mechanisms that drive the lowering of the F-region reflection points. We found, (a) on average, the change in E- and F-region refractive index is the primary driver of the Doppler flash, (b) solar zenith angle, ray’s elevation angle, operating frequency, and location of the solar flare on the solar disk can alter the ionospheric regions of maximum contribution to the Doppler flash, (c) increased ionospheric Hall and Pedersen conductance causes a reduction of the daytime eastward electric field, and consequently reduces the vertical ion-drift in the lower and middle latitude ionosphere, which results in lowering of the F-region ray reflection point.},

  abstract = {Abstract Trans-ionospheric high frequency (HF: 3–30 MHz) signals experience strong attenuation following a solar flare-driven sudden ionospheric disturbance (SID). Solar flare-driven HF absorption, referred to as short-wave fadeout, is a well-known impact of SIDs, but the initial Doppler frequency shift phenomena, also known as “Doppler flash” in the traveling radio wave is not well understood. This study seeks to advance our understanding of the initial impacts of solar flare-driven SID using a physics-based whole atmosphere model for a specific solar flare event. First, we demonstrate that the Doppler flash phenomenon observed by Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) radars can be successfully reproduced using first-principles based modeling. The output from the simulation is validated against SuperDARN line-of-sight Doppler velocity measurements. We then examine which region of the ionosphere, D, E, or F, makes the largest contribution to the Doppler flash. We also consider the relative contribution of change in refractive index through the ionospheric layers versus lowered reflection height. We find: (a) the model is able to reproduce radar observations with an root-median-squared-error and a mean percentage error (δ) of 3.72 m/s and 0.67\%, respectively; (b) the F-region is the most significant contributor to the total Doppler flash (∼48\%), 30\% of which is contributed by the change in F-region's refractive index, while the other ∼18\% is due to change in ray reflection height. Our analysis shows lowering of the F-region's ray reflection point is a secondary driver compared to the change in refractive index.},

  abstract = {Abstract Over-the-Horizon communication is strongly dependent on the state of the ionosphere, which is susceptible to solar flares. Trans-ionospheric high frequency (HF, 3–30 MHz) signals can experience strong attenuation following a solar flare that lasts typically for an hour, commonly referred to as shortwave fadeout (SWF). In this study, we examine the role of dispersion relation and collision frequency formulations on the estimation of SWF in riometer observations using a new physics-based model framework. The new framework first uses modified solar irradiance models incorporating high-resolution solar flux data from the GOES satellite X-ray sensors as input to compute the enhanced ionization produced during a flare event. The framework then uses different dispersion relation and collision frequency formulations to estimate the enhanced HF absorption. The modeled HF absorption is compared with riometer data to determine which formulation best reproduces the observations. We find the Appleton-Hartree dispersion relation in combination with the averaged collision frequency profile reproduces riometer observations with an average skill score of 0.4, representing 40\% better forecast ability than the existing D-region Absorption Prediction model. Our modeling results also indicate that electron temperature plays an important role in controlling HF absorption. We suggest that adoption of the Appleton-Hartree dispersion relation in combination with the averaged collision frequency be considered for improved forecasting of ionospheric absorption following solar flares.},

  abstract = {Abstract The term “sluggishness” was coined by E. V. Appleton in the 1950s to describe the time delay between peak irradiance at solar noon and the resulting peak in ionospheric electron density. Sluggishness can be understood as an inertial property of the ionosphere that manifests as a lag of the ionospheric response to a solar driver. As shown by Appleton, estimates of sluggishness can be used to study the chemistry of the lower ionosphere, of the D-region in particular. In this study, for the first time, we have examined ionospheric sluggishness in terms of the time delay between the peak irradiance during a solar flare and the resulting peak in ionospheric electron density using HF instruments. Estimates of the delay are obtained using HF observations from riometers and SuperDARN radars that are primarily sensitive to absorption in the D-region. Two new methods for measuring delay are introduced. Sluggishness is shown to be anti-correlated with peak solar X-ray flux and positively correlated with zenith angle and latitude. The choices of instrument, method, and reference solar waveband affect the sluggishness estimation. A simulation study was performed to estimate the effective recombination coefficient in the D-region. The coefficient was found to vary by orders of magnitude with peak flare intensity. We argue that the variation in effective recombination coefficient with peak flare intensity is highly sensitive to changes in the negative and positive ion chemistry of the D-region, which is sensitive to the incoming solar X-ray and EUV radiation.},

  abstract = {Abstract The Sun was remarkably active during the first week of September 2017 producing numerous solar flares, solar radiation storms, and coronal mass ejections. This activity caused disruption to terrestrial high-frequency (HF, 3–30 MHz) radio communication channels including observations with the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) HF radars. In this paper, we analyze the response of SuperDARN groundscatter observations and decreases in background sky noise level in response to multiple solar flares occurring in quick succession and co-occurring with solar energetic protons and auroral activity. We estimate the attenuation in HF signal strength using an approach similar to riometry and find that the radars exhibit a nonlinear response to compound solar flare events. Additionally, we find that the three different space weather drivers have varying degrees of influence on the HF signal properties at different latitudes. Our study demonstrates that in addition to monitoring high-latitude convection, SuperDARN observations can be used to study the spatiotemporal evolution of disruption to HF communication during extreme space weather conditions.},

  abstract = {Abstract Short-wave fadeout (SWF) is a well-known radio wave anomaly which follows Earth-directed solar flares and leads to severe disruption of transionospheric high-frequency systems. The disruption is produced by flare-enhanced soft and hard X-rays that penetrate to the D layer where they dramatically enhance ionization leading to heavy high-frequency absorption over much of the dayside for an hour or more. In this paper, we describe how Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) observations can be exploited to analyze SWF events. Superposed epoch analysis of multiple signatures reveals the typical characteristics of SWF. The number of SuperDARN ground scatter echoes drops suddenly (≈100 s) and sharply after a solar flare, reaching a maximum depth of suppression within a few tens of minutes, and then recovering to pre-SWF conditions over half an hour or so. The depth of echo suppression depends on the solar zenith angle, radio wave frequency, and intensity of the flare. Furthermore, ground scatter echoes typically exhibit a sudden phase change leading to a dramatic increase in apparent Doppler velocity (the so-called “Doppler flash”), which statistically precedes the dropout in ground scatter echoes. We report here on the characterization of SWF effects in SuperDARN ground scatter observations produced by several X class solar flares. We also describe the functional dependence of peak Doppler flash on solar zenith angle, frequency, and peak intensity of solar flux.},
